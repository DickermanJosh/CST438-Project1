## Overview
The Pokemon API we used is [here](https://pokeapi.co/)
## Introduction

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Josh mostly worked on setting up the database for the app and making the search by type and ability. Josh also did some work on the favorites page.

- What was the biggest challenge? 
  - The biggest challenge was getting used to the structure of the app. Specifically working with the database and testing suite was a big challenge.
- Why was it a challenge?
  - We were all new to React Native during the beginning of this project and all had to learn at a very fast pace.
It also took us a little bit to realize that we were reading documentation for an outdated version of SQLite, and that we should be using the legacy version.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - My favorite part of the project was working with the API to receive images.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - I would spend more time getting used to React and SQLite specifically.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - Documentation is extremely important when working with a group - especially if no one is all that familiar with the technology stack being used.
### Kevin Lopez
1. Kevin’s pull requests are [here](https://github.com/DickermanJosh/CST438-Project1/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AKevinlzs)
2. Kevin’s Github issues are [here](https://github.com/DickermanJosh/CST438-Project1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+assignee%3AKevinlzs)
#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Kevin’s role in this project was to work on the feature to search for a pokemon by name and adding a favorite button that would add pokemons to our database.

- What was the biggest challenge? 
  - The biggest challenge Kevin faced was familiarizing himself with React Native and understanding the app’s structure such as running the app and setting up an emulator.
- Why was it a challenge?
  - It was a challenge because we had almost no experience with React Native.
  - The challenge was addressed as time went on, we slowly started understanding React Native a little more and figuring out how React worked.
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - The most interesting part of this project was to being able to load pokemon sprites from api.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - If I could do it over again I would change nothing.
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - The most valuable thing I learned was learning how React Native works at a fast pace and building a project with a tool that I had no idea how it worked on the first day.

- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - Was getting the app to run, with no errors and passing testing.
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - Probably not spend a week trying to also learn how to implement a database as well and just focus more on completing other stories. 
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - Keep backups in case something did not work out well. Keep testing everything.
### Trent Taylor

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Trent worked on implementing the Login and SignUp pages, as well as the Home page and the LogOut functionality.  He also helped get the database running initially.

- What was the biggest challenge? 
  - Passing data from the database to the page 
- Why was it a challenge?
  - None of us knew the fundamentals of React and how state is passed from page to page
  - How was the challenge addressed?
  - We were able to use StackOverflow and ChatGPT to figure out how to use the router object to pass user data from the login screen to the Home page
- Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  - Finally getting the user data to display a welcome message on the Home page
- If you could do it over, what would you change?
  - I would split some of the tasks up into subtasks
- What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  - Getting the db set up is the most crucial part of a project. It is the foundation that everything else is built upon
## Conclusion
- How successful was the project?
  - In the end we consider the project to be a success. We didn’t finish every task we set out to and we had many problems along the way with the environment but overall we managed to create a deliverable that included most of what we wanted when we set out.
- What was the largest victory?
  - The largest victory in the project was getting SQLite setup near the beginning. There were several other victories throughout the project but the DB was the largest.
- Final assessment of the project
  - Overall we are happy with the project. Getting started with React was very difficult and because of the struggles early on we weren't able to finish all the goals we set out to. Despite that we are happy with the final deverable and the process that we took getting here.
