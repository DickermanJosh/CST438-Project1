This project is a basic CRUD app that allows a user to sign-up, login, and search for Pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/. The user can then pick their favorites among their Pokemon. The user can also delete previously-favorited Pokemon. The user can add Pokemon to their deck and view their deck from their favorites page. The user can also join a team of other users.
